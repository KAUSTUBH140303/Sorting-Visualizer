This is a visualization of some of the most famous sorting algorithms.
These include-
1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Merge Sort
4. Insertion Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Heap Sort

The screen size is 1500px in width and 750px in height. These
are arbitrary numbers and the window seemed to fit perfectly 
on my device screen.
The number of array elements is 158. I experimented with larger
values like 1100 and 1300, and although it looked better visually, 
the window kept freezing mid-algorithm due to the large array size.
Each array bar is 8px wide and this too is a result of experimentation.
In some algorithms like merge sort, I have used time delay. This is 
due to fast speed of those algorithms and the animations looked
better when slower.
Explantions for each algorithm can be found on GeeksForGeeks.
